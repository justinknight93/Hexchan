# Hexchan
An anonymous color coded text forum

I originally wrote this simple text board system back in 2016. It has captcha intergrated so if you want to host it you need to add the catcha keys to the config.php. 

I have no idea if this will work without errors at this point. I'm still refactoring a lot of this right now.
